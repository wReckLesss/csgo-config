# My Counter-Strike Config Files
These are files for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
## Info
I've customized my game quite a bit. Installing these files will Install
- My autoexec, with all my keybindings
- Simple Radar for all available maps
- Custom font (Muller Narrow)
- BananaGaming's Text Color Mod
- Some other config files, such as practice configs.

## Installation
Assuming your in `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive`, 
I've put the files in the folders they should go in. Just put the files
in the corresponding directories.
